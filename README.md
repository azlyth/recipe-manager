# RECIPE MANAGER (Work in Progress)

A web app that allows users to record their recipes (the ingredient database will be autopopulated), showing them the price and macronutrient information per serving. 

# TO RUN

On recipe-manager folder, run:

<code>
export FLASK_APP=app
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
</code>

If you need to re-init the database:

<code>
flask init-db
</code>
